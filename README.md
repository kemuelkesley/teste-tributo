## Description

This project is an online calculator designed to simplify and optimize the process of calculating taxes on invoices. The tool was created to automate a previously repetitive manual task, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

The main objective of this calculator is to allow employees to enter the value of an invoice and automatically receive the calculated tax amounts. This reduces the time and effort required for these calculations while minimizing the risk of human error.

## History

The idea for this project arose from the need to optimize the work of employees who frequently performed manual tax calculations to determine the taxes owed on invoices. To address this issue and increase efficiency, I developed a solution that automates these calculations, providing quick and accurate results through a simple and intuitive interface.

This project emerged from the need to [put studies and learnings into practice].
